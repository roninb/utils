#clit.py

Command Line Interface Twitter client or clit.py is a program I wrote to prevent myself from getting distracted by my browser everytime I wanted to take a 2 minute break to check the news. 
To you use it you should have python-twitter (https://github.com/bear/python-twitter) installed and grab app tokens and personal tokens.

Usage:
```
python clit.py -f 10 #show next 10 tweets

python clit.py --directmessage _malikbutler
Enter your message: 

```
